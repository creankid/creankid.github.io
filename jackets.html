   <p style="color:#4b4b4b">Jackets are a must have for additional style and warmth. Don't be in a rush to purchase these though, as you often receive free jackets from sports and cohorts that you join. If they are not free, the individualized jackets are for sale and are a lot more special than just the jackets sold in the Uniform Store. There are a few different styles of jackets that I would personally recommend owning. The first is a hoodie, which is the most popular cut of jacket. The next is a waterproof or rain jacket like a parka, which personally, I received free from soccer and the engineering cohort. The last kind of jacket is a windbreaker or just a light jacket for day to day where it isn't really as much for keeping you warm, but just wearing something other than a polo. These thinner jackets are free when you join track and field, which I highly recommend as well. </p>
